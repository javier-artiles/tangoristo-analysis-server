# tangoristo-analysis-server

This projects contains the code used to analyze Japanese text and map substrings to dictionary entries for the now defunct Tangoristo mobile app. I wrote this in a rush during my train commute and lunch breaks, so don't expect high quality, peer reviewed code here.

I'm going do some basic work of documenting the project and possibly add other related repos over the coming weeks. I'm NOT planning to do any active development of this project though. It is here just to give an idea of the approach I took to folks interested in writing similar apps. Today I would approach this problem in a completely different manner, I'm hoping to also document these ideas in the future.
